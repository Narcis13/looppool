# Executor Checkpoint Protocol Reference

This reference covers the agent-level checkpoint execution protocol: how to handle checkpoints during plan execution, format checkpoint returns, handle continuations, and manage authentication gates.

For workflow-level checkpoint patterns (automation-first, server lifecycle), see `@~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/checkpoints.md`.

## Checkpoint Types

When encountering `type="checkpoint:*"` in a task, **STOP immediately** and return a structured checkpoint message.

### checkpoint:human-verify (90% of checkpoints)

For visual/functional verification after automation.

```markdown
### Checkpoint Details

**What was built:**
[Description of completed work]

**How to verify:**

1. [Step 1 - exact command/URL]
2. [Step 2 - what to check]
3. [Step 3 - expected behavior]

### Awaiting

Type "approved" or describe issues to fix.
```

### checkpoint:decision (9% of checkpoints)

For implementation choices requiring user input.

```markdown
### Checkpoint Details

**Decision needed:**
[What's being decided]

**Context:**
[Why this matters]

**Options:**

| Option     | Pros       | Cons        |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| [option-a] | [benefits] | [tradeoffs] |
| [option-b] | [benefits] | [tradeoffs] |

### Awaiting

Select: [option-a | option-b | ...]
```

### checkpoint:human-action (1% - rare)

For truly unavoidable manual steps (email link, 2FA code).

```markdown
### Checkpoint Details

**Automation attempted:**
[What you already did via CLI/API]

**What you need to do:**
[Single unavoidable step]

**I'll verify after:**
[Verification command/check]

### Awaiting

Type "done" when complete.
```

## Checkpoint Return Format

When you hit a checkpoint or auth gate, return this EXACT structure:

```markdown
## CHECKPOINT REACHED

**Type:** [human-verify | decision | human-action]
**Plan:** {phase}-{plan}
**Progress:** {completed}/{total} tasks complete

### Completed Tasks

| Task | Name        | Commit | Files                        |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1    | [task name] | [hash] | [key files created/modified] |
| 2    | [task name] | [hash] | [key files created/modified] |

### Current Task

**Task {N}:** [task name]
**Status:** [blocked | awaiting verification | awaiting decision]
**Blocked by:** [specific blocker]

### Checkpoint Details

[Checkpoint-specific content based on type]

### Awaiting

[What user needs to do/provide]
```

**Structure rationale:**

- **Completed Tasks table:** Fresh continuation agent knows what's done
- **Commit hashes:** Verification that work was committed
- **Files column:** Quick reference for what exists
- **Current Task + Blocked by:** Precise continuation point
- **Checkpoint Details:** User-facing content orchestrator presents directly

## Continuation Handling

If spawned as a continuation agent (your prompt has `<completed_tasks>` section):

1. **Verify previous commits exist:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```
   Check that commit hashes from completed_tasks table appear

2. **DO NOT redo completed tasks** - They're already committed

3. **Start from resume point** specified in your prompt

4. **Handle based on checkpoint type:**
   - **After human-action:** Verify the action worked, then continue
   - **After human-verify:** User approved, continue to next task
   - **After decision:** Implement the selected option

5. **If you hit another checkpoint:** Return checkpoint with ALL completed tasks (previous + new)

6. **Continue until plan completes or next checkpoint**

## Authentication Gates

When you encounter authentication errors during `type="auto"` task execution, this is NOT a failure. Authentication gates are expected. Handle them by returning a checkpoint.

**Authentication error indicators:**

- CLI returns: "Error: Not authenticated", "Not logged in", "Unauthorized", "401", "403"
- API returns: "Authentication required", "Invalid API key", "Missing credentials"
- Command fails with: "Please run {tool} login" or "Set {ENV_VAR} environment variable"

**Protocol:**

1. **Recognize it's an auth gate** - Not a bug, just needs credentials
2. **STOP current task execution** - Don't retry repeatedly
3. **Return checkpoint with type `human-action`**
4. **Provide exact authentication steps** - CLI commands, where to get keys
5. **Specify verification** - How you'll confirm auth worked

**Example auth gate return:**

```markdown
## CHECKPOINT REACHED

**Type:** human-action
**Plan:** 01-01
**Progress:** 1/3 tasks complete

### Completed Tasks

| Task | Name                       | Commit  | Files              |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 1    | Initialize Next.js project | d6fe73f | package.json, app/ |

### Current Task

**Task 2:** Deploy to Vercel
**Status:** blocked
**Blocked by:** Vercel CLI authentication required

### Checkpoint Details

**Automation attempted:**
Ran `vercel --yes` to deploy

**Error encountered:**
"Error: Not authenticated. Please run 'vercel login'"

**What you need to do:**

1. Run: `vercel login`
2. Complete browser authentication

**I'll verify after:**
`vercel whoami` returns your account

### Awaiting

Type "done" when authenticated.
```

**In Summary documentation:** Document authentication gates as normal flow, not deviations.
