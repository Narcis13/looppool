# Milestone v1.0: GSD Autonomous Mode

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-27
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 17

## Overview

This roadmap delivered full autonomous execution for GSD, enabling Claude to reason through every decision point without human intervention. The journey started with the inner voice foundation (config flag, decision traces), progressed through context assembly and decision policies, integrated with all GSD workflows, then addressed technical debt and safety features. By completion, users can run `/gsd:new-project` through `/gsd:execute-phase` with zero human input when `autonomous: true` is set.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Inner Voice Foundation

**Goal**: Establish the basic autonomous reasoning loop with configuration and visibility
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: VOICE-01, VOICE-02, VOICE-05, VOICE-07
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Create autonomous reference documentation (patterns, defaults)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Integrate autonomous handling into execute-plan.md

**Completed:** 2026-01-26

**Key Deliverables:**
- `get-shit-done/references/autonomous.md` (318 lines) — Config reading, decision trace format, wrapper pattern
- `get-shit-done/references/autonomous-defaults.md` (295 lines) — Checkpoint defaults, graceful degradation

### Phase 2: Context-Aware Reasoning

**Goal**: Decisions are grounded in project context and tracked for consistency
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: VOICE-03, VOICE-04, VOICE-06
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Create context assembly reference and DECISIONS.md template
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Integrate context-aware reasoning into execute-plan.md

**Completed:** 2026-01-26

**Key Deliverables:**
- `get-shit-done/references/context-assembly.md` (393 lines) — Prioritized context gathering, citation format
- `get-shit-done/templates/decisions.md` (130 lines) — Persistent audit trail template

### Phase 3: Decision Policies

**Goal**: Specific policies answer common GSD questions automatically
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: POLICY-01, POLICY-02, POLICY-03, POLICY-04, POLICY-05, POLICY-06, POLICY-07
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Create decision-policies.md reference with all 7 policy definitions
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Integrate POLICY-01/02/03/04 into new-project.md
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Integrate POLICY-05 into plan-phase.md and POLICY-06/07 references into execute-plan.md

**Completed:** 2026-01-26

**Key Deliverables:**
- `get-shit-done/references/decision-policies.md` (773 lines) — 7 policies with observable conditions, 4 integration patterns

### Phase 4: Workflow Integration

**Goal**: All GSD workflows respect autonomous flag and route decisions appropriately
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: FLOW-01, FLOW-02, FLOW-03, FLOW-04
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Add autonomous handling to execute-phase workflow (failure recovery, checkpoint routing)
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Implement discuss-phase autonomous skip (exits early when autonomous enabled)
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Add autonomous handling to new-milestone (research, roadmap approval)
- [x] 04-04-PLAN.md — Add autonomous handling to auxiliary workflows (discovery, debug, resume-work)

**Completed:** 2026-01-27

**Key Deliverables:**
- 8 workflows/commands updated with autonomous flag reading
- All workflows respect autonomous mode with proper trace outputs

### Phase 5: Architecture Refactoring

**Goal**: Large monolithic files extracted into maintainable focused modules
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: DEBT-01, DEBT-02, DEBT-03, DEBT-04, DEBT-05, DEBT-06
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Extract gsd-planner.md into focused modules (<500 lines)
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Extract gsd-executor.md into focused modules (<500 lines)
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Extract execute-plan.md and deduplicate shared content (<800 lines)
- [x] 05-04-PLAN.md — Create STATE.md schema and auto-recovery, atomic JSON pattern

**Completed:** 2026-01-27

**Key Deliverables:**
- 9 new reference modules created
- gsd-executor.md: 439 lines (44% reduction)
- execute-plan.md: 787 lines (57% reduction)
- gsd-planner.md: 1036 lines (26% reduction — target missed due to estimation error)
- state-schema.md: Required/optional fields, auto-recovery algorithm
- atomic-json.md: Write-temp-verify-move pattern

### Phase 6: Safety Features

**Goal**: Safer autonomous operation with rollback and inline plan revision
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: FEAT-01, FEAT-02
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Phase commit recording and /gsd:rollback-phase command (FEAT-01)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Inline task declaration format and SUMMARY tracking (FEAT-02)

**Completed:** 2026-01-27

**Key Deliverables:**
- `commands/gsd/rollback-phase.md` (374 lines) — Safe phase reversion with git revert
- Inline task declaration format in deviation-rules.md
- Phase Commits tracking in STATE.md

---

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Em-dash (—) in trace format for visual clarity
- Full commitment mode — all decisions auto-decided when enabled
- Policies are declarative rules (IF/THEN/BECAUSE), not reasoning processes
- Observable conditions only (file checks, counts, pattern matches)
- git revert used instead of git reset for safe rollback
- Inline tasks are part of parent task commit (atomic commits maintained)

**Issues Resolved:**

- All 24 v1 requirements satisfied
- Complete cross-phase integration (22 verified connections)
- All 4 major E2E flows working

**Issues Deferred:**

- gsd-planner.md over line target (1036 vs 500) — planning estimation error, accepted as minor tech debt
- Windows UNC path handling in install.js — v2 scope
- Orphaned hook cleanup atomicity — v2 scope

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- gsd-planner.md at 1036 lines (target was 500) — extraction work completed, target was mathematically unachievable
