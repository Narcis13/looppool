Done! I've generated a prioritized implementation plan based on the IDE specifications and gap analysis. The plan is organized into 7 priority levels, starting with core infrastructure and building up to advanced features like graph visualization. Each task includes context explaining why it matters.

The plan reflects that the IDE hasn't been implemented yet (empty src/ directory) and covers all features from the 5 spec files. Tasks are ordered by dependencies and importance, with foundational work first.
## Summary

I've completed my planning analysis. After studying all 5 IDE specs and examining the codebase:

**Key Findings:**
- No implementation exists yet - src/ directory is empty
- All specs are comprehensive and well-defined
- The existing IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md was already well-structured

**Updates Made:**
- Added 15+ missing tasks discovered from detailed spec analysis
- Enhanced each priority section with requirements I found in specs:
  - Server file watching and browser auto-launch
  - State API endpoint and real-time sync
  - Command viewer dual view and terminal integration
  - State panel directory creation and file parsing
  - Graph visualization color coding and performance optimization
- Added implementation notes about lightweight approaches

The updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md now comprehensively covers all requirements from the specs and is ready for execution in priority order.
I've completed the planning phase. Here's what I did:

1. **Studied all specifications** using parallel agents to analyze:
   - IDE core requirements (3-panel layout, markdown editor, auto-save)
   - Server architecture (Node.js, 4 API endpoints, WebSocket/SSE, security)
   - Command viewer features (YAML parsing, badges, navigation links)
   - State panel (planning directory integration, progress tracking)
   - Graph visualization (d3/cytoscape, 50+ nodes, hierarchical layout)

2. **Gap Analysis**: The src/ directory is completely empty - no IDE implementation exists yet.

3. **Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** with:
   - Gap analysis summary
   - More specific implementation details (file paths, technology choices)
   - Implementation order recommendations
   - Refined tasks based on spec requirements

The plan maintains 7 priority levels with foundational work first (server, basic UI) progressing to advanced features (graph visualization, polish). Each task includes rationale and builds on previous priorities.

Ready for building phase - no code changes made.
## Planning Complete

I've analyzed all specifications and updated the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with a comprehensive, prioritized plan for building the IDE. 

**Key updates made:**
- Refined Priority 1 to use native Node.js modules (maintaining zero dependencies)
- Added detailed technical implementation guidance for each component
- Included comprehensive testing strategy with security focus
- Emphasized the project's existing patterns (esbuild usage, YAML frontmatter)

The plan is ready for execution, starting with Priority 1: Core Infrastructure. The first task will be creating the server at `src/server/index.js` and adding the "ide" npm script.
## Planning Complete

I've completed the gap analysis and updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with refined priorities based on:

**Key Findings:**
- src/ directory is completely empty - zero implementation exists
- 5 comprehensive IDE specs covering server, core UI, command viewer, state panel, and graph view
- Codebase has 108 markdown files (~30K lines) requiring efficient handling
- Largest files exceed 1,200 lines necessitating virtual scrolling
- Package.json missing "ide" script

**Updated Plan Highlights:**
- **Priority 1**: Core server with native http module, security-first approach
- **Priority 2**: Frontend with virtual scrolling for 100+ files
- **Priority 3**: Markdown editor capable of handling 1,200+ line files
- **Priority 4**: Command viewer with custom YAML parser
- **Priority 5**: State panel reading from .planning/
- **Priority 6**: Graph visualization optimized for 100+ nodes
- **Priority 7**: Performance optimizations and polish

Each task now includes specific technical rationale and all priorities remain unimplemented.

The plan is ready for execution in the next loop iteration.
## Gap Analysis Complete

After studying all specifications and the existing codebase:

**Current State Confirmed:**
- src/ directory is completely empty - zero implementation exists
- Package.json missing "ide" script as noted in the plan
- All 7 priorities from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md remain unimplemented

**Specifications Analysis:**
- 5 comprehensive spec files define a complete IDE system
- Requirements include server, frontend, command viewer, state panel, and graph view
- All align with the existing implementation plan

**Plan Assessment:**
The existing IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md is accurate, comprehensive, and well-prioritized. No updates needed - the plan correctly captures all requirements and provides clear implementation guidance.

**Recommendation:**
Begin with Priority 1 tasks to establish core server infrastructure, then proceed sequentially through the priorities as outlined.

Exiting planning mode.
The implementation plan has been updated based on a comprehensive analysis of all specifications. Key refinements include:

**Added from specs:**
- Zero-dependency philosophy section emphasizing minimal external libraries
- "Test in terminal" functionality for Command Viewer  
- File watching for entire .planning directory in State Panel
- File System Access API noted as alternative architecture
- Explicit 50+ node baseline requirement for graph visualization
- Additional UI details like argument-hint display

**Gap Analysis Confirmed:**
- src/ directory does not exist - zero implementation
- All 7 priorities remain unimplemented
- 108 markdown files across the codebase ready to be served
- Specifications align well with existing plan structure

The updated plan maintains clear priorities, specific tasks with rationale, and comprehensive coverage of all IDE components. Ready for implementation phase.
Based on my analysis, the implementation plan is well-aligned with the specifications. The gap analysis confirms:

1. **Zero implementation** - src/ directory exists but is completely empty
2. **All 5 specs are unimplemented** - ide-core, ide-server, ide-command-viewer, ide-graph-view, ide-state-panel
3. **Package.json missing "ide" script** as specified

The existing IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md is comprehensive and accurate. Since there have been no changes to requirements or implementation status, no updates to the plan are needed at this time.

## Summary

- ✅ Reviewed all 5 specification files
- ✅ Confirmed zero implementation exists
- ✅ Verified existing implementation plan remains accurate
- ✅ Plan priorities and task breakdown align with spec requirements

The implementation can proceed according to the existing plan, starting with Priority 1 (Core Server Infrastructure).
I've completed the planning mode analysis. The IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md has been updated with:

1. **Corrected Gap Analysis**: Clarified that while there's an existing TypeScript CLI tool under ralphy-main/, there's zero IDE implementation
2. **Updated File Count**: Changed from 108 to 426 markdown files
3. **Added Context**: Noted the existing ralphy implementation could provide patterns to reference

The implementation plan remains valid with all 7 priorities fully unimplemented for the IDE. The plan is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for execution.

## Planning Mode Summary

After studying all 5 IDE specifications and analyzing the codebase:

### ✅ Verification Complete
- Confirmed: IDE implementation is at **absolute zero** - src/ directory is empty
- All 5 specifications exist and are comprehensive
- Existing IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md accurately reflects all gaps and requirements
- Found valuable patterns in ralphy-main/ CLI for reference

### Key Findings
1. **Zero-dependency philosophy** is critical - only devDependency is esbuild
2. **Security patterns** from ralphy-main need enhancement with explicit path traversal prevention
3. **Auto-save patterns** with debouncing and retry logic are well-established in cached-task-source.ts
4. **No server implementation** exists in ralphy-main - all HTTP patterns are client-side

### Critical Security Addition Needed
```javascript
// Path validation MUST be implemented for every file operation
function validatePath(rootDir, requestedPath) {
    const normalized = path.normalize(requestedPath);
    const resolved = path.resolve(rootDir, normalized);
    if (!resolved.startsWith(path.resolve(rootDir))) {
        throw new Error('Path traversal attempt detected');
    }
    return resolved;
}
```

### Recommended Implementation Order
The existing plan's phased approach is optimal:
1. **Phase 1**: Server + basic frontend (Priority 1-2)
2. **Phase 2**: Editor + command viewer (Priority 3-4)
3. **Phase 3**: State panel + graph view (Priority 5-6)
