Perfect! I have successfully completed all Priority 1 tasks from the implementation plan:

## Summary

I implemented the core server infrastructure for the IDE with the following features:

1. **Created src/server/index.js** - Native HTTP server with zero dependencies
2. **Security middleware** - DNS rebinding protection and path validation to prevent directory traversal
3. **GET /api/tree** - Returns directory structure for commands/, looppool/, agents/, specs
4. **GET /api/file** - Reads files with proper error handling and security
5. **PUT /api/file** - Writes files with atomic operations (temp file + rename)
6. **SSE endpoint /api/events** - Real-time file change notifications with debouncing
7. **File watching** - Monitors all allowed directories for changes
8. **npm script** - Updated package.json to launch the new server
9. **Browser auto-launch** - Cross-platform browser opening on server start

The implementation follows all the patterns from the existing codebase:
- Zero dependencies approach
- Native Node.js modules only
- Strong security with path validation
- Atomic file operations
- Proper error handling
- Cross-platform support

All validation tests pass and the server is ready for the frontend implementation in Priority 2.
## Summary

I've successfully completed Priority 2: Frontend Foundation from the implementation plan. The IDE now has:

1. **Semantic HTML5 structure** with proper ARIA labels for accessibility
2. **CSS Grid layout** with 250px sidebar, flexible main area, and 40px top bar
3. **Collapsible file tree** with virtual scrolling preparation for 100+ files
4. **Project name display** and real-time connection status indicators
5. **EventSource client** with automatic reconnection for SSE updates
6. **Static file serving** with proper MIME types and security headers

The frontend successfully connects to the server at http://127.0.0.1:3456/ and displays:
- Looppool branding in the top bar
- Connection status indicator
- Collapsible file tree in the sidebar
- Welcome screen in the main editor area
- State panel placeholder on the right

Next priorities would be:
- Priority 3: Markdown Editor integration
- Priority 4: Command Viewer Enhancement
- Priority 5: State Panel Implementation

The foundation is solid and ready for the next iteration of development.
